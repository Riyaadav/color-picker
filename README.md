# 🎨 Mood Colour Picker dApp (Algorand)

A fun and beginner-friendly decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Algorand blockchain**, where users can **choose a colour that represents their mood** and store it on-chain. 🌈  

This project demonstrates how smart contracts can be used for simple, interactive, and creative applications — perfect for learning the basics of Algorand development.

## 📖 Project Description
The **Mood Colour Picker dApp** allows anyone to express how they feel by selecting a colour.  
Each choice is recorded on the Algorand blockchain using a smart contract written in **TEALScript (TypeScript)**.  

Think of it like a **mood diary**, but instead of words, you leave behind **colours**.  

---

## 🚀 What It Does
- Users pick a colour from the UI (e.g., Blue = calm, Red = energetic, Yellow = happy).  
- The selected colour is **stored immutably** on the Algorand blockchain.  
- Anyone can **view the latest chosen mood colours**.  
- Demonstrates the concept of **user interaction + blockchain state** in a fun way.

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Choose a colour** that reflects your current mood.  
- ⛓️ **On-chain storage** of your choice using Algorand smart contracts.  
- 🌍 **Open to everyone** — anyone with an Algorand wallet can participate.  
- 📊 **Simple, transparent results** — moods are stored publicly and can be fetched easily.  
- 🧩 **Beginner-friendly smart contract code** (great for learning Algorand).
